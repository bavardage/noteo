// - add ordering to events
 - do proper logging support
#PERHAPS NOT NEEDED  - pass handlers to events done with event_handled
# NOT NEEDED AT THIS TImE PERhAPS  - add some way of calling back a return value from events
 
AWESOME
 - escape command string

 - work out a way of identifying different event types, so that I can detect a subclass
    of notification event as a notification event #DONE



ICONS
DONE  - allow both a gtk name and path to be passed, return only ever paths

THINGS PASSED
PERHAPS NOT???! - when an event should be ended prematurely, then is it valid to 
 call handled? NO IT IS NOT IMO 


RECURRINGFUNCTIONCALLEVENT
 - add option to force repeat, even if it returns false
