// - add ordering to events
 - do proper logging support
 - pass handlers to events done with event_handled
 - add some way of calling back a return value from events
 
AWESOME
 - escape command string
 - work out a way of identifying different event types, so that I can detect a subclass
    of notification event as a notification event


ICONS
 - allow both a gtk name and path to be passed, return only ever paths

THINGS PASSED
 - when an event should be ended prematurely, then is it valid to 
 call handled? NO IT IS NOT IMO
